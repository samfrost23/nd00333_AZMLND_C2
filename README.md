# Operationalizing Machine Learning in Azure

*Overview*
This project is part of the Udacity Azure Machine Learning Nanodegree. The objective of this project is to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, consume it and create automated process creating, publishing and consuming a pipeline.

The dataset is data from a bank marketing campaign. The aim of the campaign was to increase the number of subscribers to the bank term deposit. In this project we will try to predict with a "yes" or a "no", whether a client will subscribe to the product or not.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
